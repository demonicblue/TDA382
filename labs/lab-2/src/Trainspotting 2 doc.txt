Lab assignment - Trainspotting 2

Course participants: Henrik Hugo, Simon Fransson.

The monitor implementation:
An instance of TrackMonitor represents a track which can be entered and left by a train.

TrackMonitor(String name):
   Instantiates a new monitor representing a track which requires that only one train can be on it at any given time. Sets up both the lock and the conditional value.

enter():
   Tries to acquire the monitor for the track. Will return immediately if the monitor is available. If it is not immediately available; the function will block until it gets signaled through the conditional value.

leave():
   Marks the track as clear and signals any awaiting trains.

tryEnter():
	Like the enter() function, tryEnter() will try to acquire the monitor but instead of blocking on failure it will return false. On success it will return true.

debug():
   Not important to the solution but allows for easy enabling of debug messages.


Number of conditional values:
Only one conditional value per track is required in this solution, making it a total of 6. The conditional allows trains to await a signal, marking the availability of tracks.
